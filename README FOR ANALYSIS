# TripleTen Sprint 5 Project 

This is the most recent project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program.

### An Analysis of Returned Orders for Superstore

The goal of the project was to determine the root cause of returned orders for Superstore. 

#### The Data

The dataset was provided through JSON file and is provided by TripleTen
#### The Process

I first explored the dataset to find which part of the datea could be msot useful for the goal at hand. I ran various analysis and landed with various charts to build up a visual of my analysis. 

### Results

It was found that data was limited and could be stronger if some more useful data was collected. Nonetheless, my study was able to give a picure on where the company can start digging and visually displayed it on my analysis. I have recommended an implementable action plan.
