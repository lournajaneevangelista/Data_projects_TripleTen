**Analysis of Superstore's Returned Order**

**Submitted by: Lourna Jane Reyes**



**Executive Summary:** This analysis aims to assess superstoreâ€™s return orders by providing the possible root cause and what implementable actions may be put into place to reduce the returns. Data has been provided and was processed using Tableau, however over the course of the analysis, it was observed that more data is necessary specifically on the cost of return and if possible collect reasons for returns . What this study found is that there is a significant activity in the 3rd quarter of the year during the back-to-school season, where copiers are the highly returned item in August, but chairs pose the highest return cost in September. Looking into the return rate would give an idea of the consumer behavior, that would be best for a general analysis. However, it is vital to see how it is actually affecting the company financially through the cost of these returns. The company should reduce return rate and return cost by collecting more data on the actual cost of return, reviewing the 3rd quarter activity and reassembling a new or better after sales support system.
